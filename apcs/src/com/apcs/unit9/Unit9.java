unit9: Inheritance
Lesson 1: Inheritance
    In Java all classes can inherit attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (methods) from another class.
    The class being inherited from is called the parent class or superclass. 
    The class that is inheriting is called the child class or subclass.
     In Java how many parents can a class have?
     All classes in Java have one and only one parent class.
   
     why we use inheritance?
     Inheritance allows you to reuse data and behavior from the parent class. If you notice that several classes share the same data and/or behavior, you can pull that out into a parent class. This is called generalization.
 If you don’t specify the parent class in a class declaration which of the following is true?
  It inherits from the Object class.
Lesson 2: Inheritance Overriding Methods
    Method overriding occurs when a public
    method in a subclass has the same method
    signature as a public method in the superclass.
    Overloading a method is when several methods have 
    the same name but the parameter types, order, or number are different.
Lesson 3: Is-a and Has-a Relationships
  is-a relationship, but more accurately it’s a is-a kind of relationship
  If I had a class ParkingGarage should it inherit from the class Vehicle?
  No, a parking garage is not a kind of vehicle. Instead it has vehicles in it which 
  implies that the ParkingGarage class would have a field that tracks the vehicles in it.
